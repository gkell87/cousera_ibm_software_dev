Understanding CSS Selectors - Tags, IDs, and Classes

About this Reading
In this reading, we will delve into three key types of CSS selectors: Tags, IDs, and Classes. These selectors provide a powerful way to target specific HTML elements and apply styles accordingly.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) play a crucial role in styling web pages and understanding the role of CSS selectors for controling how styles are applied.

CSS Selectors Overview
What are CSS Selectors?
•	CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements.
•	They define the relationship between HTML elements and the styles applied to them.
Why are Selectors Important?
•	Selectors allow precise targeting of specific elements.
•	They enable the creation of consistent and visually appealing designs.

Tag Selectors
Tag selectors target HTML elements based on their tag names. They apply styles to all instances of a particular tag.
Syntax for Tag Selector:

1.	tagName {
2.	    /* Styles for the elements with the specified tag name */
3.	}

Replace tagName with the actual HTML tag name you want to style.
Example: Styling Headings

1.	h1 { 
2.	    /* Styles for h1 elements */ 
3.	    color: #3366cc; 
4.	    font-size: 24px; 
5.	}

•	This CSS rule targets all <h1> elements.
•	Applies blue color and a font size of 24 pixels to all <h1> headings.

ID Selectors
ID selectors target a specific HTML element using its unique ID attribute. The ID attribute is assigned to an HTML element to provide a unique identifier for that element within the document. ID selectors are denoted by a hash symbol (#) followed by the ID.
Syntax for ID Selector:

1.	#yourID {
2.	    /* Styles for the element with the specified ID */
3.	}

Replace yourID with the actual ID assigned to the HTML element.
Example: Styling a Unique Element

1.	#header {
2.	    /* Styles for the element with id="header" */ 
3.	    background-color: #f0f0f0; 
4.	    padding: 10px; 
5.	}

•	This CSS rule targets an element with the ID header
•	Applies a light gray background and 10 pixels of padding to the element.

Class Selectors
Class selectors target HTML elements with a specific class attribute. Multiple elements can share the same class. Class selectors are denoted by a period (.) followed by the class name.

Syntax for Class Selector:

1.	.className {
2.	    /* Styles for the elements with the specified class */
3.	}

Replace className with the actual class name you want to style.
Example: Styling Multiple Elements

1.	.highlight { 
2.	    /* Styles for elements with class="highlight" */
3.	    background-color: #ffd700; 
4.	    color: #333; 
5.	}

•	This CSS rule targets all elements with the class highlight
•	Applies a yellow background and dark text color to all elements with the class highlight
