# Intro into HTML, CSS and JS

## HTML
HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard language used to create and structure the content of web pages. 
It uses markup—code in the form of tags and elements—to define and organize various elements on a webpage, such as text, headings, images, and links. 
Web browsers read this HTML code to interpret and display the content, making it the fundamental building block of almost every website you visit.

## CSS
CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML or XML.
CSS dictates how elements on a webpage should be displayed, controlling aspects such as:
  - Colors and Fonts: Setting text colors, font families, sizes, and weights.
  - Layout and Positioning: Arranging elements on the page, controlling spacing, margins, padding, and alignment.
  - Visual Effects: Adding styles like borders, shadows, backgrounds, and even animations and transitions.
    
Essentially, HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, while CSS provides the visual styling, making the page aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.
The "cascading" aspect refers to how style rules are applied, with more specific rules overriding general ones in a hierarchical order.
