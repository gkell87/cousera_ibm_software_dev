# Intro into HTML, CSS and JS

## HTML
HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard language used to create and structure the content of web pages. 
It uses markup—code in the form of tags and elements—to define and organize various elements on a webpage, such as text, headings, images, and links. 
Web browsers read this HTML code to interpret and display the content, making it the fundamental building block of almost every website you visit.

## HTML5
HTML5 is the current version of the HyperText Markup Language.
HTML5 is considered the "living standard" for all web development, and its capabilities are continuously updated.

Key differences between HTML5 and older versions
 - HTML5  reduces reliance on third-party browser plugins like Adobe Flash.
 - Has native 'audio' and 'video' tags for embedding media directly.
 - Introduced new semantic tags like 'header', 'footer', 'nav', 'section', and 'article' to provide meaning and better structure to content.
 - Includes the 'canvas' element for drawing graphics with JavaScript and supports Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) directly.
 - Provides much larger and more efficient client-side storage options through localStorage and sessionStorage.
 - Built with mobile devices in mind, making it easier to create responsive websites that work on any screen size.
 - Features a simplified '!DOCTYPE html' declaration and improved parsing rules for better compatibility and consistent error handling across browsers.

Important features and APIs in HTML5
  - Geolocation API: Allows web applications to access a user's geographical location, with their permission, for location-based services.
  - Offline capabilities: Enables web applications to function even without an internet connection by storing data locally.
  - Web Workers: Allows JavaScript to run in the background without affecting the responsiveness of the web page.
  - New form controls: Offers new input types like date, email, number, and range, which improve validation and user experience.
  - Drag-and-Drop API: Provides native support for users to drag and drop elements on a web page, which enhances interactivity.

## CSS
CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML or XML.
CSS dictates how elements on a webpage should be displayed, controlling aspects such as:
  - Colors and Fonts: Setting text colors, font families, sizes, and weights.
  - Layout and Positioning: Arranging elements on the page, controlling spacing, margins, padding, and alignment.
  - Visual Effects: Adding styles like borders, shadows, backgrounds, and even animations and transitions.
    
Essentially, HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, while CSS provides the visual styling, making the page aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.
The "cascading" aspect refers to how style rules are applied, with more specific rules overriding general ones in a hierarchical order.

## JS
JS or JavaScript is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language primarily known for enabling interactive and dynamic content on websites. 
It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML (which provides structure) and CSS (which provides styling).

Key characteristics and uses of JavaScript include:
 - Client-Side Scripting: Historically, its main role has been to run in web browsers, allowing for features like animated graphics, interactive forms, dynamic content updates, and user interface manipulation without requiring a full page reload.
 - Server-Side Development: With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming, enabling the creation of web servers, APIs, and other backend functionalities.
 - Versatility: Beyond web development, JavaScript is used in various other domains, including mobile app development (with frameworks like React Native) and desktop applications.
 - Dynamic and Interpreted: It is a dynamic language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime, and it is typically interpreted or just-in-time compiled rather than fully compiled before execution.
 - Multi-Paradigm: JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming (using prototypes and classes).
